## Why This Talk?

Ever wanted to contribute to open source but held back?

. . .

- "I'm not experienced enough"
- "The codebase is way too big"
- "I wouldn't even know where to start"

. . .

> I felt the same way. Turns out, you don't need to be ready — you just need to begin.

## Common Misconceptions

| Myth | Reality |
|------|---------|
| Only for experts | Beginners are welcome everywhere |
| Need to know the whole codebase | You can start with one file |
| Requires huge time commitment | Even 30 minutes helps |
| Only code counts | Docs, tests, triage all matter |

---

## What Counts as a Contribution?

- 🐛 Bug reports
- 📝 Documentation fixes
- 🧪 Adding or improving tests
- 🔧 Small bug fixes
- 💬 Answering questions in issues
- 📦 Packaging and CI improvements

---

## Finding the Right Project

Start with tools you already use.

- Check their GitHub for `good first issue` or `help wanted` labels
- Read the `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Look at recent activity — is the project alive?
- Join their communication channel (Discord, Slack, mailing list)

---

## Navigating a New Repository

```text
├── src/            # Source code
├── tests/          # Test suite
├── docs/           # Documentation
├── CONTRIBUTING.md # How to contribute
├── README.md       # Project overview
└── setup.py        # Build config
```

Start with `README.md` → `CONTRIBUTING.md` → issue tracker.

## Working with Maintainers

::: {.incremental}
- Read the contribution guidelines first
- Be respectful and patient
- Ask before starting large changes
- Keep PRs small and focused

:::

. . .

::: {.incremental}
- Open Source is slow
  - But that's a good thing!

## What You Gain

::: {.incremental}
- 🔍 Better debugging and code-reading skills
- �️ Exposure to production-qualitmy engineering
- 🌍 Collaboration across global communities
- 📋 A visible portfolio of real work
- 🚀 Career growth through demonstrated initiative
:::

---

## Staying Consistent

- Start small — don't aim for heroic PRs
- Set a rhythm (spend few mins every day)
  - Most days I just go over 10+ issues looking for gaps
- Celebrate small wins
- It's okay to take breaks

---

## Practical Tips

- Use `git log` and `git blame` to understand code history
- Run the test suite locally before submitting
- Write clear commit messages
- Reference the issue number in your PR
- Don't be afraid to ask questions

---

## Open Source is Not...

- ❌ An obligation
- ❌ Free labor
- ❌ Only for "rockstar" developers

## Open Source IS...

- ✅ A learning ecosystem
- ✅ A community
- ✅ A career accelerator

---

## Key Takeaways

- Open source is approachable — start before you feel ready
- Small contributions compound over time
- Communication and respect go a long way
- It strengthens real engineering skills
- Your contributions build a visible professional portfolio

---

## Thank You {.center}

::: {.incremental}
- > Your first contribution to open source will be the hardest but best experience as a developer. Thousands of people have contributed their knowledge to develop some of the best projects that have progressed mankind to where we are today.
- Are you ready to make your first contribution?
