## Why This Talk?

Ever wanted to contribute to open source but held back?

. . .

- "I'm not experienced enough"
- "The codebase is way too big"
- "I wouldn't even know where to start"

. . .

> I felt the same way. Turns out, you don't need to be ready — you just need to begin.

                  : ~50% speed boost in integer division
    section 2021
        Apr 2021 : Biggest PR merged
                  : ~80%+ speed boost in division
        Jul 2021 : Became a NumPy Maintainer

## Diving into features - ``show_runtime``

```{pyodide}
import numpy as np
np.show_runtime()
```

[PR Link](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21468)

:::{incremental}
- Found this while working on SIMD enhancements
- Solved a real pain point on identifying how NumPy was built and not just what it's running
- Today it's used in every issue creation template in NumPy
- Still working on enhancing this to different modes
:::


```{pyodide}
import numpy as np
np.show_config()
```

## Diving into features - integer division

```{pyodide}
import numpy as np
np.floor_divide([1., 2., 3., 4.], 2.5), np.array([1., 2., 3., 4.]) // 2.5, np.float64(128) // np.int32(2)
```

:::{incremental}
- Every integer division flow in NumPy goes through [this](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/18075) change
- Required understanding SIMD dispatch and collaborating with two other contributors
- Took over 6 months of effort to achieve over 80% speed improvements
- Since this change landed before the AI boom, it collectively, along with other SIMD changes, reduced the carbon footprint of Python on LLMs
:::

## Diving into features - ``bitwise_count``

```{pyodide}
import numpy as np
np.bitwise_count(1023), np.bitwise_count([2**i - 1 for i in range(16)])
```

[PR Link](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21429)

- Counts the number of 1-bits in the absolute value of the input
- Implement a recent [paper](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html#CountBitsSetParallel) with just 12 CPU cycles
- But the paper (and Core Python) only works for 64 bits. Had to reearch and do the math to get it working for 8, 32 and 128 bits.
- Took over 2+ years to get it working end-to-end for scalars and vectors

---

## Not everything works 🥲 - ``float.hex/from_hex``

```{pyodide}
import numpy as np
np.hex(1.2)
```

[PR Link](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20083)

- Worked on it for 4 years
- As the change is massive with not much upside, it's still not merged
- Lessons Learned: Look for value in the community before working on something

## Working with Maintainers

::: {.incremental}
- Read the contribution guidelines first
- Be respectful and patient
- Ask before starting large changes
- Keep PRs small and focused
- Respond to review feedback
:::

. . .

::: {.incremental}
- Open Source is slow
  - But that's a good thing!
:::

## Staying Consistent

- Start small — don't aim for heroic PRs
- Set a rhythm (spend few mins every day)
  - Most days I just go over 10+ issues looking for gaps
- Celebrate small wins
- It's okay to take breaks

---

## Practical Tips

- Use `git log` and `git blame` to understand code history
- Run the test suite locally before submitting
- Write clear commit messages
- Reference the issue number in your PR
- Don't be afraid to ask questions

---

## Key Takeaways

- Open source is approachable — start before you feel ready
- Small contributions compound over time
- Communication and respect go a long way
- It strengthens real engineering skills
- Your contributions build a visible professional portfolio

---

## Thank You {.center}

::: {.incremental}
- > Your first contribution to open source will be the hardest but best experience as a developer. Thousands of people have contributed their knowledge to develop some of the best projects that have progressed mankind to where we are today.
- Are you ready to make your first contribution?
