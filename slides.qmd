## Why This Talk?

Ever wanted to contribute to open source but held back?

. . .

- "I'm not experienced enough"
- "The codebase is way too big"
- "I wouldn't even know where to start"

. . .

> I felt the same way. Turns out, you don't need to be ready — you just need to begin.

## Diving into features - show_runtime

```{pyodide}
import numpy as np
np.show_runtime()
```

:::{incremental}
- Found this while working on SIMD enhancements
- Solved a real pain point on identifying how NumPy was built and not just what it's running
- Today it's used in every issue creation template in NumPy
- Still working on enhancing this to different modes
:::


```{pyodide}
import numpy as np
np.show_config()
```

## Working with Maintainers

::: {.incremental}
- Read the contribution guidelines first
- Be respectful and patient
- Ask before starting large changes
- Keep PRs small and focused
- Respond to review feedback
:::

. . .

::: {.incremental}
- Open Source is slow
  - But that's a good thing!

## Staying Consistent

- Start small — don't aim for heroic PRs
- Set a rhythm (spend few mins every day)
  - Most days I just go over 10+ issues looking for gaps
- Celebrate small wins
- It's okay to take breaks

---

## Practical Tips

- Use `git log` and `git blame` to understand code history
- Run the test suite locally before submitting
- Write clear commit messages
- Reference the issue number in your PR
- Don't be afraid to ask questions

---

## Key Takeaways

- Open source is approachable — start before you feel ready
- Small contributions compound over time
- Communication and respect go a long way
- It strengthens real engineering skills
- Your contributions build a visible professional portfolio
