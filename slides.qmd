## Why This Talk?

Ever wanted to contribute to open source but held back?

. . .

- "I'm not experienced enough"
- "The codebase is way too big"
- "I wouldn't even know where to start"

. . .

> I felt the same way. Turns out, you don't need to be ready — you just need to begin.

timeline
    title From First PR to Maintainer
    section 2019
        Dec : First OS contribution | Garbage Collector — clang support
    section 2020
        Feb : First NumPy contribution
        Dec : First big contribution | ~50% speed boost in integer division
    section 2021
        Apr : Biggest PR merged | ~80%+ speed boost in division
        Jul : Became a NumPy Maintainer
        Nov : First full feature | bit_count
```

## Diving into features - ``show_runtime``

```{pyodide}
import numpy as np
np.show_runtime()
```

[PR Link](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21468)

:::{incremental}
- Solved a real pain point on identifying how NumPy was built and not just what it's running
- Today it's used in every issue creation template in NumPy
:::


```{pyodide}
import numpy as np
np.show_config()
```

---

## Diving into features - integer division

```{pyodide}
import numpy as np
np.floor_divide([1., 2., 3., 4.], 2.5), np.array([1., 2., 3., 4.]) // 2.5, np.float64(128) // np.int32(2)
```

:::{incremental}
- Every integer division flow in NumPy goes through [this](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/18075) change
- Over 6 months of effort yielded 80%+ speed improvements
- Landing before the AI boom, this change, along with other SIMD optimizations, helped reduce the carbon footprint of Python-based LLM workloads
:::

## Diving into features - ``bitwise_count``

```{pyodide}
import numpy as np
np.bitwise_count(1023), np.bitwise_count([2**i - 1 for i in range(16)])
```

[PR Link](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21429)

- Counts the number of 1-bits in the absolute value of the input
- Based on a [paper](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html#CountBitsSetParallel) that runs in just 12 CPU cycles, though it took 2+ years to get merged
- The paper and CPython only support 64-bit inputs, so additional work was needed to extend it to 8, 32, and 128 bits

---

## Not everything works - ``float.hex/from_hex``

```{pyodide}
import numpy as np
np.hex(1.2)
```

[PR Link](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20083)

- This change is massive with not much upside, it's still under progress for the past 4 years
- Lessons Learned: Look for value in the community before working on something

---

## Working with Maintainers

::: {.incremental}
- Join Slack channels and mailing lists to stay up to date with communications
  - Ask questions on small, well-researched topics in Slack
- Attend open community calls or newcomer hours to connect with maintainers
- Address all review comments before requesting another review
:::

. . .

::: {.incremental}
- Open Source is slow
  - But that's a good thing!
:::

---

## Usage of AI

AI can be used for the following:

::: {.incremental}
- Fill in boilerplate code
- Deep dive into the code base or specific modules
- Refactor UT to get more coverage
:::

. . .

::: {.incremental}
- AI is a useful tool!
  - But use it with caution
  - Don't add to the maintainers burden
:::

## Practical Tips

- Start small — don't aim for heroic PRs
- Run the test suite locally before submitting
- Set a rhythm (spend few mins every day)
  - Most days I just go over 10+ issues looking for gaps
- Reference the issue number in your PR
- It's okay to take breaks
- Celebrate small wins!

## Key Takeaways

- Open source is approachable — start before you feel ready
- Small contributions compound over time
- Communication and respect go a long way
- It strengthens real engineering skills
- Your contributions build a visible professional portfolio

## Thank You {.center}

::: {.incremental}
- > Your first contribution to open source will be the hardest but best experience as a developer. Thousands of people have contributed their knowledge to develop some of the best projects that have progressed mankind to where we are today.
- Are you ready to make your first contribution?
